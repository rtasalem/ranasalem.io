If you’re wondering where you are, this is my little corner of the internet. How you ended up here is a mystery to me too, but nonetheless, welcome. My name is Rana and I’m a (currently junior) software developer based in Scotland. If you nosey around this website you’ll find out more about myself.

You also already found and are reading my blog. In future posts, you can expect my thoughts and opinions on tech and software (mostly), extreme overuse of commas, and generally witnessing me finding my feet in this challenging, rewarding, excruciating career path I’ve chosen.

That’s all for now.
