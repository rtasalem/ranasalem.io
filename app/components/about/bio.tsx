      <p className='text-justify'>I'm Rana, a software developer based in Scotland with a passion for building open source software and
        continuously improving the digital user experience. My educational background in forensic science fostered in me a love for experimenting
        during my days in the lab, tinkering with all kinds of instruments, primarily atomic force and scanning electron microscopes. Today,
        this translates into a joy for building scalable applications and digital services with code.</p>
